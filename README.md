# Project 1 for Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree
This repo contains the code for Project 1 in the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree course.  The data was taken from the **Inside Airbnb** website at http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html and uses the March 2021 datasets for both Seattle and Boston.  The Jupyter notebook _Project1.ipynb_ was created using Anaconda and a core Python version of 3.6.

This project analyzes the AirBnB listing prices from March 2021 to see what are the most important factors driving listing prices in Seattle and Boston.

# AirBnB Listing Price Analysis Blog Post
Project 1 for Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree

## Installation
This notebook was created using a standard Anaconda Python installation with a core python version of 3.6.

## File Descriptions
A single Jupyter notebook, _Project1.ipynb_, was used for the analysis. 

The data files are _calendar.csv_ and _listings.csv_, which contain booking prices by date and listing attributes, respectively.  The Boston data is in /Data/Boston/ and the Seattle data is in /Data/Seattle/.  

## Project Motivation
This is a Udacity project for their Data Scientist Nanodegree program. I was interested in finding out what drives AirBnB price listings and if there are any stragegies for saving money on booking prices. This project analyzes the AirBnB listing prices from March 2021 to see what are the most important factors driving listing prices in Seattle and Boston.

## Acknowledgements
The data was taken from the **Inside Airbnb** website at http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html and uses the March 2021 datasets for both Seattle and Boston. I also browsed some Kaggle projects which dealt with the Seattle AirBnB data, such as https://www.kaggle.com/carazzz/242-project-seattle-airbnb.
